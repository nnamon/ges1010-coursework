# Introduction

Historical amnesia is not only an option in the construction of a Singaporean
nation, but quite possibly, a necessary condition of it. All groups, societies,
races, and nations have participated in the act of forgetting at some point in
their history and it can be argued that the act is inherent to surviving the
human condition. However, it is undeniable that there are destructive drawbacks
to the practice. This essay will attempt to frame historical amnesia in the
light of older cultures and connect the dots against the Singaporean context.

# Historical Amnesia

Historical amnesia, or social amnesia as most of the international literature
calls it, is a widespread phenomenon occuring at multiple sociological and
societal levels. According to Russell Jacoby [^rj1], social amnesia can be
defined as a society's collective *'repression of remembrance'*; a forgetfulness
of their own historical past. Bakieva et al place a negative emphasis on this
act of forgetting by referring to it as *'the crisis of memory'*.[^bdh1] The
authors even go to the lengths of asserting that historical amnesia is a
dangerous disease that destroys the foundations of cultures.

The prevalence of the forgetfulness phenomenon can be found in the LGBTQ
community [^et1], in the attitudes of White Americans towards the slave past of
African Americans [^du1], or even entire developing countries in South Africa.
[^jdb1] The ancient Romans practiced *damnatio memoriae*, the punishment of
being completely erased from history. In Roman society, this was deemed a fate
worse than death. [^v1]

At times, this historical amnesia is engineered by leaders, politicians,
or governments who wish to encourage the repression of recollecting certain
events or the recasting of that recollection in a certain light. In the German
context, this has been termed *Geschichtspolitik*, or the *Politics of Memory*.
[^gppi1] This is the form of historical amnesia that this essay will be focusing
on.

# To Forget is to Live

Nietzche wrote in his 1983 article, *On the uses and disadvantages of history
for life*, 'For this reason, it is possible to live almost without remembering,
indeed, to live happily, as the beast demonstrates; however, it is generally
completely impossible to live without forgetting.' [^fn1] Verily, many
individuals find solace in forgetting a painful past; to let a traumatic memory
wash away and move onto greener pastures. Why not an entire nation?

In a way, an event at a point in time in history is second in importance to the
memories that surround it. Antze and Lambek suggests that these memories carry
an impression of the local narratives, biases, and assumptions to develop into
remembrances charged with *'performative'* meaning. [^pa1] The truth are not the
facts but the fictions that are spun in the heads of the masses.

Germany is one such nation that has been plagued by agonising memories. While
much of Europe celebrate the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 on May 8, Germans
are conflicted. The day is a symbol of failure for the country, a reminder of
the country's dark past. [^sp1] However, sentiment is slowly changing as a
result of historical amnesia. Many are beginning to embrace the day as the day
Germany was liberated from Nazi dictatorship, an act of turning one's identity
into another victim to emancipate oneself from one's past and emphasise the
concept of 'otherness'.

Perhaps there is no better way to deal with such a horrific past than to simply
forget it.

# White Lies in Schools

After apartheid ended in South Africa during April of 1994, the majority rule
government sought to revamp and revise the school curriculum to move past its
history of racial segregation and discrimination. It sought to forget and reform
the teachings of the recently toppled white supremacist order. The general
accepted consensus was that South African society was 'better not to have
history at all than to have that kind of history again'. [^pss1]

In China, the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989 is a lethal memory to have. The
politicians of the Communist Party of China have gone to great lengths to
expunge the protests from the history books, including school textbooks. An
informal experiment by Louisa Lim took her to four Beijing campuses in which
only 15 out of 100 students could identify the iconic Tank Man photograph taken
during the period of unrest. [^ll1] The Internet is heavily restricted and
performing searches for 'Tiananmen Square' while in China yields no results
about the masssacre.

Singapore is no stranger to the concept of letting one's past go in favour of
progress. Devan Nair in 1981 explained that holding onto Singapore colonial past
was detrimental to the nation as a whole because it was a symbol of
discrimination, repression, and poverty. It was a goal of his generation to
destroy and in its essence, bring about the forgetting of these old values.
[^cy1]

# Conclusions

Throughout history, collective forgetfulness, manipulated or otherwise, has been
a useful tool wielded by leaders and governments to affect public sentiment
towards a less than savoury past. It has been used as a coping mechanism, a
political weapon, and a means to progress. While the moral implications of this
act may be difficult to think about, it is a natural part of the human
condition. Throughout history, humans seek to adapt to changing environments and
one way of doing that is to simply change the way something is perceived or to
forget about it.

After all, it is a lot easier to control minds than to build a time machine.
