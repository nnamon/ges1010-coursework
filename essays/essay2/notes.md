'While the need to separate religion from politics has been stressed repeatedly,
politics [in Singapore] remain deeply intertwined with religion.' Discuss this
diagnosis in light of the history of state-religion relations in Singapore since
the 1950s.

# Outline

## Introduction

From the Maria Hertogh Riots in 1950 to the Catholic churches' alleged
involvement in the Marxist Conspiracy of 1987 to the controversy of Amos Yee's
viral videos criticising the Christian and Muslim faith in 2015, it is plain to
see that religion has always been a major factor in Singaporean politics.
Religion is a looming spectre, thoroughly suffusing the course of Singaporean
history and has proven itself to be one of the defining aspects of society that
has largely affected public policy.

This essay will provide an account of state-religion relations in Singapore from
the 1950s to the late 2010s. It will present the case that while the Singaporean
government has stressed the need for religion to be separate from politics, it
has not only remained deeply intertwined with religion, but it is inevitable for
it to remain so.

## Background

* Multiculturalism
* How does this translate from race and culture into religion?
* Singapore's committment to racial harmony

Singapore in 2017 is a multicultural society comprising of multiple racial and
cultural groups of which the Chinese, Malay, and Indian groups represent the
bulk of the populace. [^mul1] This translates not only into racial differences
but also differences in religion, an aspect of society that is not easy to reason
about or control. At times, religion can be contentious when pushed to
fundamentalism. There have been events in Singapore's history in which religion
has drawn blood.

Hence, religion cannot be ignored by the Singaporean government if a peaceful
society is to be established in Singapore.

## Religion and Politics in Malaya

* Maria Hertogh riots in 1950
* Singapore achieved self-rule from the British in 1959.
* Prior to secession from Malaysia in 1963, Prior to secession in 1963, PM Lee
  struck an independent note by issuing a
  declaration on religious freedom for all in Singapore, promising the
  continuation of
  the “policy of religious toleration” after Malaya.9 His government did not
  intend to
  enact laws prohibiting propagation of faiths to Muslims, which article 11(4)
  of the
  Federal Constitution of Malaysia (1959) [Federal Constitution] authorised.
* Independent from Malaysia on 9 August 1965.
* Singapore’s more liberal article 15 religious freedom guarantee diverged from
  article
  11(4) (which enabled legislatures to adopt laws to control religious
  propagation
  directed at Muslims), excising this qualification, as according “special
  treatment” to
  “a particular religion” was inconsistent with a “democratic secular state”.1
* 1964 race riots

On 11 December 1950, the custody battle for Maria Hertogh to be returned to her
Catholic biological parents escalated into a riot that ran over two days and
resulted in eighteen deaths after images were published showing Maria kneeling
before the Virgin Mary in a Catholic convent. Maria was raised as a muslim by
Che Aminah binte Mohamed through the Japanese Occupation while her mother was
held in a Japanese internment camp. The images enraged the largely Malay and
Muslim crowd protesting the custody hearings and the court's swift decision to
throw out the appeal against returning Maria to her birth parents triggered a
violent backlash. The incident was a painful lesson in Singapore's history and
highlighted the dire need to prevent racial enclaves from forming and to ensure
integration between the different races. [^st1]

Singapore's desire for secularism has always marked it as separate from the
Malaysia. Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia defines a 'Malay' as a
Muslim who conforms to the Malay custom. Article 153 accords Bumiputra
privileges to such 'Malays'. Hence, religion is explicitly tied to the standing
and the rights of a citizen under the Malaysian Constitution. Furthermore, Islam
was declared as the official religion of Malaysia by Tunku Abdul Rahman in 1960.
Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963 meant that these articles now applied
to the citizens of Singapore.

However, PM Lee assured the public in a 1963 press statement that his government
would not shift their stance on their existing 'policy of religious toleration
in Singapore'. He further asserted that the government has no intention to
introduce legislation preventing the 'propagation of faiths' to Malays, and in
essence, Muslims as required by article 11(4) of the Federal Constitution of
Malaysia. This was further emphasised in the Report of the Constitutional
Commission published in 1966. Paragraph 38 of the report describes the original
Article 11(4) as 'singling out a particular religion for special treatment' as
'inconsistent' with the 'democratic secular state'. [^cc1] The proposed
amendments to the article are now incorporated as Article 15 of the Constitution
of the Republic of Singapore, a fundamentally more liberal piece of legislature
compared to the original Article 11(4).

Indeed, the differing political ideologies of the PAP and UMNO in Malaysia
caused social tensions within Singapore and Malaysia. The PAP sought equality
regardless of race, language, or religion while the UMNO sought elevated rights
for the Bumiputras. The UMNO controlled press as well as other Malay groups
stirred up anti-PAP sentiments by preying on racial and religious sensibilities
by painting the Chinese as aggressors on the Malay race. This ultimately
culminated in the violent racial riots of 1964 in July and September. The
violence eventually led to Singapore's separation from Malaysia with PM Lee
citing 'irreconciliable differences'. Singapore embarked on its own trajectory
as a secular state and experienced no more racial riots after independence.

## Singaporean Secularism

* What does it mean to separate the Church from the State?
* How does it manifest around the world?
* Theocracies vs secularism
* The spectrum of religiousity in government and complete irradication of
  religion from society and government.
* Singapore instead seeks to find and maintain a stable ground in which it can
  maintain peace between different races, cultures, and religions.
* The concept of public and private spaces.
* "Anti-theocratic but not anti-religion"
* Maintaining peaceful co-existence above all.
* Article 15(1) of the Constitution protects the religious freedom of all
  Singapore citizens. But this is within some limits.
* The designation of Jehovah's Witnesses in 1972 and the Unification Church in
  1982 made them unlawful societies and thus a restriction on a form of
  religion.
* Foolhardy to Take Harmony For Granted. The Government also ensures that the
  State is secular and even-handed. The Government is not pro-any religion.
* Internal Security Act, Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act
* Involvement of (approved) religious leaders with the establishment of the
  Presidential Council for Religious Harmony.

Singapore's approach to secularity [^long1] is born from its desire for harmony
between vastly diverse groups of people. Thus, instead of eradicating religion
completely from its state or maintaining a stoic religion-free method of
governance, it seeks a balanced stance whereby the religious peace can be
maintained. Thus, the government has concluded through its actions that while
religious freedom is accorded to its citizens, this freedom is held on a very
tight, short leash. [^eth1]

The Singapore government creates the concept of public and private spaces in
which the citizen is free to practice and believe their preferred beliefs in the
private space but limits the extent to which they are allowed to come out into
the public arena. For example, administering a sermon to willing congregants in
a Church is permissible but administering the same sermon on a street corner
at Geylang Serai to the majority muslim crowd is not. Invisible boundaries are
set by the government and the community. Crossing these boundaries is grounds
for official legal and sometimes criminal action against transgressors.

There are multiple laws that the government uses to enforce this but the most
important of them is the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act of 1990. The act
allows the Minister for Home Affairs to restrict the activities of any person
deemed a threat to the religious peace. The act also restrains those who attempt
to push a political agenda or stir up anti-government sentiments under the guise
of religion. The proposed check for this power is the Presidential Council for
Religious Harmony in which President approved religious leaders are appointed to
represent the major religions.

Another similar law is the Sedition Act of 1948 in which publications and speech
that threatens the social fabric of Singapore is criminalised and may be
suppressed. Additionally, section 298A of the Penal code criminalises speech and
acts intended to provoke on religious or racial grounds. While the Maintenance
of Religious Harmony Act aims at restricting a transgressor, the Internal
Security Act of 1960 empowers the government to detain the individual without
trial.

## Christianity in Singapore

Christianity has been subject to legal action on the part of the government in
the short history of Singapore. A prominent example is the restriction of the
Jehovah's Witnesses in 1972. This is due to the incompatibilities between the
conscription duties of the Singaporean male and the refusal of the adherents to
bear arms.

In May 1987, Operation Spectrum saw 22 Catholic church members including Vincent
Cheng, a church worker, detained without trial for the threat they posed to the
nation as Marxist agents. The government invoked the Internal Security Act
with the justification that were a danger to national security. They were
accused of using the church as a cover for their subversive activities. Chong
asserts that the PAP government detained these people because they were
advancing their socialist political agenda through the religious institution and
that the potential for the church to control the direction of public discourse
was great. [^tch1]

## Islam in Singapore

* Islam is not only a religion but an all-encompassing set of rules to govern
  not only the personal moral code but society.
* Malay race tightly intertwined with islam
* Shariah Law
* Islamic State
* Muslim Ordinance Act of 1960

As one of the major racial groups of Singapore, Malays are a great concern to
how public policy is shaped. As discussed previously, the religion of Islam is
very tightly coupled to the Malay race. As such, Islam must impact the laws of
Singapore greatly as well regardless of the secularity of the nation state.

Islam is not merely a belief system but it is presented as a 'complete way of
life'. It comprises a full system of governance in the form of Sharia Law.
The laws govern the 'obligations, prohibitions, and recommended actions' of the
believer. [^isl1] As such, it even prescribes the judicial process and
punishments for crimes. Many believes of Islam even go as far as to support a
full theocratic Islamic State.

For the country to maintain its religious harmony, it must allow muslims to
practice some form of Sharia Law to be suitable as a place of residence. The
Administration of Muslim Law Act of 1968 allows for the Sharia Court to govern
matters relating to muslim marriages as well as certain Islam related matters
such as Halal certifications and Madrasas.

## Conclusions

Following Singapore's history from its colonial beginnings to after its
separation from Malaysia allows us to understand the PAP government's decisions
to handle the tumultous topic of religion the way it has. Maintaining the peace
within the social and religious fabric is the highest priority, held above the
personal freedoms of the individual and agendas of religious institutions. The
religions in Singapore co-exist in a stable state allowed by the government.
Any slip in this precarious balance will spell disaster and is hence why the
politics in Singapore has to be aware of and remain intertwined tightly with
religion. The events of 1950 must not be allowed to repeat itself.

[^long1]: The separation of the Church and State is a common concept between modern
nation-states in which the government maintains a political distance from any
religious body. This is in opposition to the concept of a 'theocracy' in which
the religious body forms the government of the nation-state. One example of a
theocracy in which religion is tightly coupled to the politics is the Islamic
Republic of Iran in which the laws of the country are shaped according to
compatibility with Sharia Law.

There are many different variants of secularism. In France, the concept of
Laïcité is an application of secularism in which religious influence in
government is actively prohibited. In Marxist ideology, religion is viewed as
something to be purged and perhaps even replaced by the communist state. The
Khmer Rogue sought to suppress all religion under Pol Pot's regime in Cambodia.
The distinction between France's concept of secularism from the Khmer Rogue's
can be described as the difference between irreligiosity versus
anti-religion.
