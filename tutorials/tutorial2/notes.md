# Notes

‘There can be little doubt that what ignited and sustained Singapore’s "struggle
for independence" was the fire of a Singaporean nationalism forged during the
revolutionary upheaval of the Second World War and its aftermath.’  Discuss.

## Points

* There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and
  rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers'
  discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive
  stoppages in public transport and other services.
* The decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace
  and the rise of anti-colonial and nationalist sentiments, epitomized by the
  slogan Merdeka, or "independence" in the Malay language.
* The war also led to the emergence of new mindset.  This view has been widely
  supported by many of Singapore’s post-war leaders (like Lee Kuan Yew, S.R.
  Nathan, S. Rajaratnam, Said Zahari, Fong Sip Chee), who traced their political
  awakening to the Japanese Occupation.
* Separate Singapore Nation: The war led to the launch of the Malayan Union
  scheme in its aftermath that resulted in Singapore’s severance from its
  Malayan mainland.
* New set of nationalist leaders: Lee Kuan Yew, S.R. Nathan, S. Rajaratnam, Said
  Zahari, Fong Sip Chee
* In 1963, Singapore joined Malaysia, relieving it of colonial rule and becoming
  an autonomous state within the Malaysian federation. After a fallout in the
  relations between the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and the
  People's Action Party (PAP), the ruling parties of the Federation and
  Singapore respectively, full independence came about with Singapore's
  expulsion from Malaysia in 1965.
* Communists: The MCP decided to launch its armed revolt in June 1948 and it
  embarked on a terror campaign to destabilize British rule.
