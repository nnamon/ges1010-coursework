## Writeup

Objectively, the plight of women from 1965 as a result from government policy
has improved. This can be seen in the increasing percentage of women accepted
into the workforce in a census taken from 1957 to 1990 as well as the government
policies put into place prior to 1965. The various acts preceeding 1965 such as
the Prevention of Bigamous Marriages Ordinance, and the PAP First Five Year Plan
were drafted with intentions to protect the rights of women, who were
traditionally left at a disadvantage with regards to traditional gender roles in
common chinese, malay, and indian communities. After 1965, there existed various
efforts to improve the lot of the common woman. Muslim women were given rights
with the ratification of the Administration of Muslim Legislation Act in 1966
with clauses to protect the interests of the wife in a muslim relationship.
AWARE, the Association of Women for Action and Research, was started in 1985 to
promote gender equality and has been influential in influencing Singaporean
policy. One such example are the recent revisions proposed in the Penal Code
in 2006. Additionally, yhr  Additionally, the Abortion Act, ratified in 1968,
was a step forward in giving rights to women over their bodies.

However, there were attempts by the government to control the population. In
1968, the Voluntary Sterilization Act was a blantant form of eugenics and in
1983, the Graduate Mother’s Priority Scheme was an attempt by the government to
encourage 'more intelligent' mothers to have babies. The intent of the
government when introducing these acts is objectionable.
